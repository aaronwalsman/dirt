TypeError: scan body function carry input and carry output must have the same pytree structure, but they differ:

The input carry train_state_active is a tuple of length 2 but the corresponding component of the carry output is a tuple of length 3, so the lengths do not match.

Revise the function so that the carry output has the same pytree structure as the carry input.
