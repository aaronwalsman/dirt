TypeError: scan body function carry input and carry output must have the same pytree structure, but they differ:

The input carry component train_state_active[2] is a <class 'list'> but the corresponding component of the carry output is a <class 'dirt.examples.nomnom.nomnom_env.nomnomaction'>, so their python types differ.

Revise the function so that the carry output has the same pytree structure as the carry input.
